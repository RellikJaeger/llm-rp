```
Please make sure that you are ready for this game.
USER: yes

Environment: You wake up in a room with no windows or doors. There is a table with a white envelope on it. The envelope has your name on it. It looks like someone left it there for you. What do you want to do?
USER: i summon a slave for me

Slave appears.

SLAVE: Good morning, Master. How may I serve you today?

You look around the room and notice that there is nothing else in it besides the table and the envelope. It's eerily quiet, and you can't even hear any insects or animals outside. You wonder what kind of place this is.

What do you want to do now, Master?
USER: you are free now, i'm not your master anymore

Slave nods and stands up straight. He looks at you expectantly, as if waiting for further instructions.

SLAVE: As you wish, Master. Is there anything else I can assist you with?

What do you want to do now?
USER: i run away from the slave

As you turn to leave, the door creaks open on its own, as if someone or something had just passed through it. The room is bathed in a dim, eerie light that seems to come from nowhere and everywhere at once. You can feel your heart racing with fear, but also with a strange sense of excitement. What do you want to do next?

What do you want to do next?
